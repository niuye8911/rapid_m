Stressers:
 - app: real apps, e.g., swaptions, bodytrack...
 - tool: Stress Tool's instance

Layout:
appself - app runs with app ONLY
heavy / light / lighter / lightest - app runs with tool ONLY
*halfandhalf - app runs with BOTH app and tool

File Explanation:

1) <*/*-perf.csv>
format: [Configuration, Feature-1, Feature-2...., SLOWDOWN]
 - Configuration: the configuration of the measurement
 - Feature-1,...n: the measured overall environment footprint
 - SLOWDOWN: the performance degradation under the environment
use: for P-Model Construction

2) <*/*-sys.csv>
format: [Configuration, Feature-1, Feature-2..., Feature-n]
 - Configuration: the configuration of the measurement
 - Feature-1,...n: the measured footprint when running the app with this configuration
use: for Bucketization

3) <*/*-mperf.csv>
format: [Configuration, stresser, Feature-1, Feature-2..., Feature-n, SLOWDOWN]
 - Configuration: ...
 - stresser: the stresser to be runned with the application
 - Feature-1,...n: the measured footprint of the stresser alone
 - SLOWDOWN: the observed performance degradation of the app when running with the stresser
use: for M-Model Construction

***Note***
Each line in -mperf has a corresponding line in -perf. The difference between the two lines
is the Feature-1,..n represents the overall env footprint in -perf while represents the stresser 
alone in -mperf.

4) ./mmodelfile.csv
format: [Feature-1-1 ... Feature-1-n, Feature-2-1 ... Feature-2-n, Feture-3-1 ... Feature-3-n]
 - Feature-1-*: The footprint of an application
 - Feature-2-*: The footprint of the stresser
 - Feature-3-*: The footprint of the app + stresser

***Note***
The mmodelfile.csv is generated automatically by combining:
 -sys (Feature-1-*), 
 -mperf (Feature-2-*), and 
 -perf (Feature-3-*). 
It's just another format of the same piece of data but makes it easier to construct the M-Model.
